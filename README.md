# Game-of-Life-Java-
Undergraduate 1st Year Computer Science Module 

Unfortunately, I don't currently have the code I actually wrote for this project. The coursework was designed to progress through 7 workbooks and submit each weekly task which would either result in a pass or fail mark, which I passed all of.

This project involved:
• Extending classes, as well as specifying and providing implementations for Java interfaces
• Inheritance and the use of inner classes for encapsulation
• Event handlers to control the execution of a graphical application

To see the workbooks, follow this link to the Cambridge computer laboratory website: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/ProgJava/materials.html

If I do ever regain access to the code I wrote, I will be adding it to this repository.
